# CPPLineCounter
An easy to use C++ tool that allows you to count code lines in your project.

Requires MinGW on Windows, or g++ on Linux in order to build the script.
Check this instruction on how to install MinGW on Windows: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html
If you are using any other C++ compiler like Visual Studio C/C++, it is expected to work just fine, 
since no special libraries are used in the script. 

All necessary instructions are provided as comments in the .cpp file.
The scripts that build the script in aforementioned systems are also provided.
